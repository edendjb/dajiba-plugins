AAA is an Ashita 3 plugin for FFXI that automatically reports ToDs of
selected high value targets (e.g., HNMs).

Upon receiving a death message for an allow-listed mob, the plugin will
automatically post to a selected Discord channel using webhooks, then
place a linkshell message containing an altertaru-style TOD message.

TODs are automatically converted to Eastern Time.  This requires a
specific timezone library that contains separate dependencies and files.
Usually, these files are downloaded and installed upon first invocation.
However, this may be unstable. 

Depends on: 
- json.hpp
- tz library for timezones.  This is also required at runtime when
  loading the plugin, or it will crash.  
- httplib for webhooks
- openssl library for using https to discord webhooks. Look for
  libcrpyto_static.lib and libssl_static.lib binaries for linking. 

Built in Visual Studio 2022 CE using 32-bit library target
